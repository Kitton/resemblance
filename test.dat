Where the resemblAnce of two documents is the intersection of features over the union of features from two documents.
This metric can be used to calculate a fuzzy similarity between two documents. 
For example, D1 and D2 have 50% of their terms the same and each document has 10 terms. 
 Their resemblance would be .33 (5/15). 
 By extending what features are used as the unit of comparison, terms, sentences, or any other document information can be used for comparison.
Many researchers have looked at using resemblance given some threshold t to find duplicate documents 
(Brin, Davis et al. 1995; Shivakumar and Garcia-Molina 1995; Garcia-Molina, Gravano et al. 1996; Shivakumar and Garcia-Molina 1996; 
Broder, Glassman et al. 1997; Shivakumar and Garcia-Molina 1998; Fetterly, Manasse et al. 2003), 
where if t was exceeded the documents would be considered duplicate. 
 Two general issues have been explored when using resemblance approaches.  
The first is what features and threshold t should be used when calculating resemblance of documents.
  The second is efficiency issues that come into play with large collections and the optimizations that can be applied (Broder 1998).
The second most common approach in determining the similarity of two documents to each other is cosine (Salton, Yang et al. 1975). 
 This approach represents each document as a vector in n-dimensional space.
  A documents similarity to another document is then defined as the distance between the two vectors, Equation 2. 
 This approach has been extended by researchers to incorporate term frequencies,
 tf*idf weighting Equation 3, etc. to improve the effectiveness of similarity comparisons for various tasks
 e.g. clustering (Salton, Yang et al. 1975; Singhal, Buckley et al. 1996; Sanderson 1997; Buckley,
 Cardie et al. 2000; Hoad and Zobel 2002).  
For duplicate detection a binary feature representation produces a similarity of two documents similar to term based resemblance. 
 Thus, as the distance of two documents approaches 1, they become more similar in relation to the features being compared.
